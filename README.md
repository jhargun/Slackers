# CSC630 Project 2: Slackers

Slackers is a basic direct messaging app that allows for the creation of users, creation of chats, and sending messages.

## Instructions
This app has already been uploaded to Heroku, and you can access it with the link provided in the project description. Operating it is relatively straightforward: there are forms and buttons for logging in, creating a user, editing user information, creating a chat, switching chats, and sending messages.

If you wish to run this app locally or reupload it somewhere else, you will simply need to `git clone` it:
```
git clone https://github.com/jhargun/Slackers
```

This app is built with the Django framework, so make sure that you have it with `pip install django` or by downloading it from [the website](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
