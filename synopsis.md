# Starting synopsis

This is a list of the resources off of which we built this project.

## Past projects
* Project 1: [wheredoyoulive](https://github.com/invinciblejackalope/wheredoyoulive). This project gave us a lot of the backbone Django knowledge that we needed to run a Django project in the first place, including config files, forms, and templating. We reused the index, FormPage, and ErrorPage files but with new CSS and some HTML tweaks to make them better-looking and more informative. (The home page is totally built from scratch, though.)
