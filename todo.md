# Future to-do list

(in approximate order of priority)

* Instant messaging, so that users don't have to reload the page every time they log on
* Sort chats by most recent message order
* Group chats
* Profile pictures for users
* Better password management (confirm password, password reset)
* Ability to send images and other files
* Automatic link detection + link previews
* Markdown in messages
* Read receipts (maybe, depends on what we want out of the app)
* Active now tags (maybe)
* Editing messages (maybe)
* Customizable chat colors
* Polls? since forms are relatively easy to implement
